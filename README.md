\# Association Rule Mining: A Support-Sensitive Analysis Across Transactional Datasets



This repository accompanies a research project focused on \*\*scalable Association Rule Mining (ARM)\*\* using the \*\*Apriori algorithm\*\* across large-scale transactional datasets (100k to 500k records). The project investigates how varying \*\*minimum support thresholds\*\* influence the volume, structure, and quality of frequent itemsets and association rules.

\## üîç Overview



\- \*\*Objective\*\*: To analyze the behavior of ARM under different support levels and dataset sizes.

\- \*\*Approach\*\*: Applied Apriori on 5 synthetic transaction datasets, with support values ranging from 5,000 to 25,000.

\- \*\*Metrics Evaluated\*\*: 

&nbsp; - Number of frequent itemsets

&nbsp; - Number of association rules

&nbsp; - Maximum itemset length

&nbsp; - Average confidence

&nbsp; - Lift values (rule strength)
